## Assignment operators

|Name|Shorthand operator|Shorthand operator|
|-|-|-|
|Assignment|x = f()|-x = f()|
|Addition assignment|x += f()|x = x + f()|
|Subtraction assignment|x -= f()|x = x - f()|
|Multiplication assignment|x *= f()|x = x * f()|
|Division assignment|x /= f()|x = x / f()|
|Remainder assignment|x %= f()|x = x % f()|

## Increment and Decrement

increment ++ and decrement --, which are very often found together with loops. 
These unary operations increase and decrease by one the number stored in the variable:

let i = 0;

i++; // 0

i++; // 1

i--; // 2

i--; // 1


let i = 0;

++i; // 1

++i; // 2

--i; // 1

--i; // 0
